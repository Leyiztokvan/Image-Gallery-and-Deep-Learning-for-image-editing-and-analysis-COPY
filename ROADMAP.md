# Roadmap

## Welcome & Project Summary

**Project Name:** Image Gallery and Deep Learning for image editing and analysis
**Mission Statement:** An image gallery editor that does basic editing functions and uses a CNN model for further analysis.
**Welcome Contributors:** Welcome to our project! This roadmap serves to have a birds eyes perspective over the project which is expected to be constantly updated in terms of having a well-written documentation and contributed to the image handling and segmentation capabilities. This will be regularly updated with progress and documentation. 

## Milestones & Tasks

### Project Initialization (25.04.2024)
- **Group Organization:** Formation of the project team, distribute and assign roles and establish communication protocols.
- **Preliminary Setup:** Creation of a GitHub repository, project management and ensure all members have access to resources.

### Environment Familiarization (02.05.2024)
- **Familiarization with existing networks:** Research and review existing master files of the U-Nets for developing the fundamental knowledge.
- **Organize image data for Image Gallery:** Research and collect image datasets for segmentation with good data quality and traceability. Primary focus will be on open source based medical images. Other type and sources of images can be used, if deemed convenient.
- **Setup environment & network:** Installation of required libraries and dependencies for image gallery/editor and U-Net.

### Network Setup (09.05.2024)
- **Pre-process Image Data:** Apply pre-processing techniques such as Standardization to be in conformity with the requirements of the network.
- **Perform training with U-Nets:** Once the initial parameters are locked in the segmentation, compute a first training of the model and validate the setup and pre-processed data.

### Implementation and testing (16.05.2024)
- **Changed the project scope** Now using the project Image Gallery Editor with additonal classification analysis using CNN model
- **Run tests on trained model:** A set of defined testing and validation protocols must conducted to evaluate the performance of the model.
Document results and learnings: Summarise the models validation accuracy, sensitivity & specificity, and potential enhancements of the model.

### Visualization (23.05.2024)
- **Generate visualizations of results:** Creation of aesthetic plots from the output of the network such as the classification results and metrics (learning curves and  overfits/underfits)

### Project Presentation (30.05.2024)
- **Finalize Presentation:** Complete the presentation slides
- **Rehearsal of the presentation:** Practice the presentation
- **Presentation:** Delivery of the presentation in class and pointing out the achievements and impact on image analysis.

## Timeline & Relevant Events
- **Weekly Meetings:** Discussion of the teams progress and troubleshoot any problems.
- **Review of Milestones:** After the submission of the milestone deliverables, a review session will help evaluate the progress and adjust for the upcoming milestones.
- **Feedback from Advisor:** Regular inputs from the technical advisor to refine methodology.
