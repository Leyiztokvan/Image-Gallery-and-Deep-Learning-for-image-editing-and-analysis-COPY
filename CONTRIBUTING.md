# Current Issues and Areas of Improvements/Contributions

Please refer to our README.md and CHANGES.md to see all the issues and changes we have implemented so far. At the moment, the app runs as expected with no errors. However:

1. There is a lot of room for improving the performance while running our app and interacting with the CNN.
2. To optimize our image processing pipeline to adapt to point 1.

Contributions:

As mentioned above in improving our UI/UX a GUI would be the next major step in improving the usability of the app. On top of all: Please document your endeavours so that the community can admire your hard work and the app can continue to thrive even longer as a project!
